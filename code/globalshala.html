            <p>On compairing the Reach of each campaign with the total amount spent on each campaign, it can be analysed that campaigns 3, 4, 10, and 11 have less reach. However, the amount spent on these campaigns are almost similar to 6 and 7 which have better reach. So, campaign 3 and 11 are the least cost effective and have least reach.</p>
